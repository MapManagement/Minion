# Minion
Minion is going to be an application for simple VM management of QEMU/KVM machines.
It'll help you to deploy already existing virtual machines on other hosts or
to create new and untouched minimal guests. Details are still work in progress
and will certainly evolve from tests, future ideas and inspirations.
